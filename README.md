- 👋 Hi, my name is Anıl Talha and I am a computer engineering student from Ankara. After completing my high school education in electronics, I started studying computer engineering at Selçuk University. I am currently a 2nd year student and I am developing projects by joining communities in the field of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Cybersecurity is my passion and I work hard to improve myself in this field.
- ✨ Personally, I am interested in nature sports and animals. In my free time, I like to go for walks, set up camps or play with my pets. Being in nature relaxes me and gives me energy. I also enjoy reading books, listening to music and watching movies. I would love to travel to get to know different cultures and see new places.
- 👀 Among the topics I want to specialize in cybersecurity are network security, penetration testing, malware analysis, cryptography and cyber intelligence. I do research and follow new technologies to constantly improve myself in these areas.
- 🌱 I have 4 years of experience in cybersecurity. I have participated in small-scale projects and know programming languages as well as Linux and Pardus operating systems. I attend online courses, seminars and competitions related to cybersecurity. I also want to connect with people who work or want to work in the field of cybersecurity and exchange ideas.
- 💞️ Among the things employers would want to learn about me are my communication skills, adaptability to teamwork, problem-solving ability, openness to learning, ability to manage time and ability to work under stress. I have developed these skills both academically and professionally and have evidence.
